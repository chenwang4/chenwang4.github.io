## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). 
I am currently working in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) under [Prof. Sarah Monazam Erfani](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/639922-sarah-monazam-erfani), [Prof. Christopher Leckie](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6335-christopher-leckie) and [Prof. Tansu Alpcan](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/425318-tansu-alpcan). 

My research lies at the intersection of **anomaly detection** and **machine learning** - with a specicial focus on inferring intentions of goal-oriented agents. More specifically, my Ph.D. project is about finding appropriate representations to quantify agentsâ€™ intentions and design an anomaly detection model that is suitable for the sequential decision making process. While the low-level features of trajectories may vary, we hypothesise that the underlying intention that drives an agent is potentially a more robust indicator of whether a behavior is normal or anomalous. My research topic is also closely related to **Inverse Reinforcement Learning** and **Imitation Learning** from the perspective of Intent Inference.

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at [Beijing Institue of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) in 2019 and my master's degree at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) in 2021.
